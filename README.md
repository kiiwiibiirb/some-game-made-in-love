# Some Game made in love

This is the first game I'm gonna be developing for the Nintendo Switch homebrew scene and not abandoning. It is written in the Love2D port for the 
Switch made by the amazing TurtleP, which you can find [here](https://github.com/TurtleP/LovePotion) I'm hoping to get a good game eventually made, but 
we know this won't happen lmao
