This is the first game I'm gonna be developing for the Nintendo Switch homebrew 
scene and not abandoning. It is written in the Love2D port for the 
Switch made by the amazing TurtleP, which you can find at 
https://github.com/TurtleP/LovePotion I'm hoping to get a good game eventually 
made, but we know this won't happen lmao

The fuck if I know what this game is about! I'm making this as I learn how to
code, so I'm not really trying to make a story right now haha! All you can even
do right now is walk and jump. Hell, I'm trying to get the animation working and
even that is proving to be a bit of a challenge!

This game is written in LovePotion, a port of the 2D framework Love. This is 
meant to run on the Nintendo Switch, so I can't say for certainty if it'll work 
on anything else like Windows, macOS or Linux. There is a 3DS port of Love that, 
if I get enough money to buy one, will be ported to the 3DS!
